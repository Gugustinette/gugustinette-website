# More thoughts about games on the web

A few month ago, I wrote an article featuring my [thoughts about games on the web](/blog/articles/thoughts-about-games-on-the-web), and why I think it's necessary to create a dedicated game engine for the web.

A lot happened since then :
- My game engine, [Fibbo](https://fibbo.dev) will soon turn 1 year old ([first commit](https://github.com/fibbojs/fibbo/commit/8bb9066ab58fce58b088a408e274a3f764884e4e) was on the 29th of April 2024).
- [levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio) recently popularized a new coding trend, called "Vibe coding" (basically using LLMs to generate code) which enabled web developers to create games pretty easily.

I think it's time to write a follow-up to my previous article, and share my thoughts about the future of games on the web.

## Vibe coding

The recent "Vibe coding" trend emphasizes a few important points :

### Games on the web are cool

As I said in my previous article, if the web is the best platform for communicating with your friends, it's not so far from being the best platform for playing games with them too.
It cleary shows that even if these games are very basic and ugly-looking, they benefit from the fact that they are on the web, and thus easily accessible.

### LLMs in game development

The reason all these web developers are able to create games so easily using AI is because AI knows the technologies implied in the process.

I've seen people asking why they're not using traditional game engines like Unity or Godot, and the answer is simple : LLMs don't know these engines, and they don't know how to use them.

LLMs are trained on whatever data they can find on the web, so their efficiency is limited to what's available on the web. And what's available on the web is mostly web technologies.

The web industry is galvanized by an open-source culture, the best web technologies are open-source, and there are a lot of resources available. But when it comes to games, the best technologies are proprietary, and there are not so many resources available. How many games are open-source ? Not so many.

## Open source games ?

Games being made with web technologies, by web developers, will very likely increase the number of open-source games. And that's a good thing, because in the massive amount of games that will be created, some will actually be good.

Having good open-source games will not only increase AI's habilities to create games, but also enable new possibilities.

### Moding

One very cool aspect of open-source games is that they can be modded easily. Modding always has been a big part of the gaming culture, and it's a great way to learn how to create games.

Some popular games actually comes from mods, like Counter-Strike, which was a mod of Half-Life, or Dota, which was a mod of Warcraft III.

And some games still have a big community of modders, like Minecraft, Skyrim, or even GTA V.

### E-sport

You were probably not expecting me to talk about e-sport in this article, but I think it is quite possible that open-source games will be the future of e-sport.

First, modding being easier will make games easier to cast, for example by adding a missing spectator mode or tracking data more easily.

Second, it means games won't be proprietary, and thus competitions won't be controlled by a single entity. It will be easier to create competitions, and it will be easier to create a competitive scene.
For example, League of Legends' competitive scene is controlled by Riot Games, and third-party tournaments are not allowed. But if the game was open-source, it would be possible to create a competitive scene without Riot Games.
Any entity, could create any competition, and it would be possible to have a competitive scene without any entity controlling it.

Lastly, it means we can change the rules at any time. Don't like the current meta ? Change it. Don't like the current balance ? Change it. Don't like the current map ? Change it.
If your changes are good, they will be adopted by the community, and a new way to play the game will emerge.

The same way traditional sports do not belong to a single entity, e-sport should not. As fay as I know, you can play football with your friends without FIFA's permission or supervision.

Why should it be different for e-sport ? Right now, because games are very expensive and thus proprietary, but making games open and way easier to create will change that.
